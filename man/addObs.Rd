\title{Add observation equations to model object}
\usage{
addObs(form, ..., obsnames = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{form}{formula specifying the observation equation to be added to the
system.}

\item{...}{formulas similar to \code{form}, used to allow specifying
multiple formulas by comma-seperation rather than providing a list.}

\item{obsnames}{character vector specifying observation names only used when
when the observation left-hand side is a function call. See details.}
}
\description{
Add an observation equation to the \code{ctsmTMB} model-object that links
states to an observed variable.
}
\details{
\subsection{\code{obsnames}}{

The \code{obsnames} argument is used when the left-hand side of \code{form}
is a function of a variable i.e. \code{log(y)} (when its of
class 'call' instead of 'name'), as in Example 3. The user should then only
provide data for \code{y}, and the log-transformation
is then handled internally.

The supported functions are those discussed in the \code{\link{addSystem}}.
