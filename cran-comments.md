* This is a new release.

Since last rejection the following changes have been made:

1. The description has changed for the better - more concise, and fixed missing
quotations (i.e. 'C++' rather than C++). The description now also contains a 
few relevant references.

2. I have added documentation examples in the .Rd files. The examples all use the
same data - this data is added in *data/Ornstein* and a *R/data.R* file explains the contents
of the data.
