Description: The purpose of 'ctsmTMB' (Continuous-Time Stochastic Modelling using Template Model Builder) is to enable user-friendly parameter and state inference and forecasting in (multi-dimensional) stochastic state space systems. These are partially observed systems whose latent states evolve according to a set of stochastic differential equations, and with algebraic discrete-time observation equations. A user-friendly interface is provided with the object-oriented 'R6' package for defining, estimating and forecasting a user-defined model. The 'TMB'/'RTMB' packages provide automatic differentiation of the likelihood function, in addition to other computational advantages and convenience features, for fast and accurate inference. The forecasting features of the package are available in C++ using the 'Rcpp' package universe, to improve computational speed. The available inference methods are the Linear and Extended Kalman filters, in addition to a Laplace "filter" based on the Laplace approximation (enabled by 'TMB'/'RTMB').
